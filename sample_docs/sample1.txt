Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with generative models to answer questions using both stored knowledge and external documents. This approach improves factual accuracy and transparency in AI systems.

RAG systems typically consist of three main components:
1. A document store or knowledge base
2. A retrieval system that finds relevant documents
3. A generative model that synthesizes answers

The process works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base based on the input query, then using those documents as context for a language model to generate a more accurate and grounded response.
