Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

## Key Areas of AI

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include:
- Machine translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Text summarization
- Question answering systems

### Computer Vision
Computer vision allows machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. Applications include:
- Image recognition
- Object detection
- Facial recognition
- Medical image analysis
- Autonomous vehicle navigation

### Expert Systems
Expert systems are AI programs that mimic the decision-making ability of human experts in specific domains.

## AI Ethics and Challenges

As AI systems become more powerful, important considerations include:
- Bias and fairness
- Privacy and security
- Transparency and explainability
- Job displacement
- Ethical decision-making

The future of AI holds great promise for solving complex problems while requiring careful consideration of its societal impact.
