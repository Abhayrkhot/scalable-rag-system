# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common algorithms include:
- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- Random forests
- Support vector machines
- Neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Techniques include:
- Clustering (K-means, hierarchical)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Association rule learning

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions.

## Applications

Machine learning is used in many domains:
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles
